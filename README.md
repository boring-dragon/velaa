A Simple mini microframework I wrote in PHP.This is not a production-level framework. This was mainly built to learn about building an MVC framework. Anyone is welcome to update or use the codes :)

I am currently working on the router. it has lot of limitations. anyone is welcome to improve it. previously this framework was using [simple php router](https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router). If you need more Routing features replace the built in router with this :) .

### Note: Documentation is on the way.
